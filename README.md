# P4sim module in ns-3 for Programmable Data Plane simulation

P4sim is a P4-driven network simulator aiming at combining P4, the state-of-the-art programmable data plane language and ns-3, one of the most popular network simulators. P4sim is an open-source project under Apache License 2.0.

Our implementation was built upon the the P4-driven Network Simulator Module, as outlined in:
