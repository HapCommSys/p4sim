# Examples

The example consists of two parts:

* A simulation script in ns-3, which is used to build the simulation environment.

* A set of files in the `p4src` directory, including the network topology description (`topo.txt`), the P4 program(`*.p4, *.p4i, *.json`), and the corresponding flow table configuration (`flowtable_x.txt`).
